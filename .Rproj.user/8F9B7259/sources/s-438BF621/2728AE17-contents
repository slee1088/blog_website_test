<p>I was working on the *igraph* package in R at work a couple of weeks ago and although it did the job, it lacked a bit of a visual presence. Here is a [website](https://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph) full of igraph network graphs for your reference.</p>

<p>Thought I'd have a look at D3 Network graphs. Looks promising thus far! Enjoying the interactivity of the nodes. It's also very surprisingly easy to implement.</p>

```{r setup, include=TRUE,eval = TRUE,warning=FALSE}
library(networkD3)
data(MisLinks)
data(MisNodes)

forceNetwork(Links = MisLinks, Nodes = MisNodes, Source = "source",
               Target = "target", Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
               Group = "group", opacity = 1)

               
```
