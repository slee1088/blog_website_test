title: About this blog
---

Hi there, I'm Scott, currently working as a data analyst. I set this blog up to act as a repository for some of the interesting pieces of work that I do in my spare time and also to act as a quick resource for myself and others in my field for trivial tasks that can get easily forgotten in the details such as remembering the connection string used to connect to SQL server from a client software.

I've always been fascinated with front-end technologies having started my data career in digital marketing and hope to keep developing and learning this area of specialisation to embed them into the data workflows that I currently work on. 

For any details about the materials in this blog, please send me an email at [slee1088@gmail.com](mailto:slee1088@gmail.com) or reach me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-lee-0aa2a3a8).
