title: About this blog
---

Hi there, I'm Scott, currently working as a data analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. I set this blog up to act as a repository for some of the interesting pieces of work that I do in my spare time and also to act as a quick resource for myself and others in my field for trivial tasks that can get easily forgotten in the details such as remembering the connection string used to connect to SQL server from a client software.

I've always been fascinated with front-end technologies having started my career in digital marketing and hope to keep developing and learning this area of specialisation to embed them into the data workflows that I currently work on.
