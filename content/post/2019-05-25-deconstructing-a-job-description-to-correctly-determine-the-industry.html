<p><strong>Some Context</strong></p>
<p>After reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Machine-Learning-Third-Brett-Lantz/dp/1788295862/ref=asc_df_1788295862/">this great machine learning textbook by Brett Lantz</a>, I was left wondering where I could use some of the techniques taught in the book for my personal use.</p>
<p>Personally, when I search for jobs on websites like Seek, I tend to narrow my search to a specific role. The dangers with this is that, in recent times, data roles can go by many names. Different companies may use a different title for essentially the same role. Searching can therefore become difficult because of this. Even if you do find a role that sounds right for you, you realise after reading the job description it isn’t!</p>
<p>Using a dataset available in Kaggle (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/australian-job-listings-data-from-seek-job-board">Australian job listings data from Seek job board</a>), I decided to deconstruct the job description, word by word, to build a Naive Bayes classifier that would predict which industry the job falls under.</p>
<p><strong>Workflow</strong></p>
<p>The workflow follows closely to what Brett Lantz uses in his textbook - so check the textbook out!</p>
<ul>
<li>First step - read in csv file into R. Note the encoding - the file had some uncommon characters that was making it difficult to use string functions.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;seek_australia_sample.csv&quot;,locale = readr::locale(encoding = &quot;windows-1252&quot;))
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   pageurl = col_character(),
##   crawl_timestamp = col_character(),
##   job_title = col_character(),
##   category = col_character(),
##   company_name = col_character(),
##   city = col_character(),
##   post_date = col_datetime(format = &quot;&quot;),
##   job_description = col_character(),
##   job_type = col_character(),
##   job_board = col_character(),
##   geo = col_character(),
##   state = col_character(),
##   salary_offered = col_character()
## )</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For the purposes of this blog, I decided to focus on the Healthcare &amp; Medical industry. I also created a classifier for Banking and Financial Industry but the results were less than clearcut with jobs in the Information &amp; Communication Technology and Insurance industry among others overlapping and also getting returned back (as expected given the similarities between the industries). Healthcare &amp; Medical appeared more insulated, although a few industries did encroach, in particular, Education and Community Services.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>data_flagged &lt;- data %&gt;%
  mutate(flag=ifelse(category %in% c(&quot;Healthcare &amp; Medical&quot;),&quot;Yes&quot;,&quot;No&quot;)) %&gt;%
  mutate(no_chars=nchar(job_description))</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The following utilises a text mining package named <em>tm</em>. More details of this package can be found in <em>Text Mining Infrastructure in R, Feinerer I, Hornik K and Meyer D, Journal of Statistical Software, 2008, Vol. 25, pp. 1-54</em>. I will not go into detail with the following code but you can consult the textbook or the Journal.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>descriptions_corpus &lt;- VCorpus(VectorSource(data_flagged$job_description)) ##supply job descriptions into VCorpus
descriptions_corpus_clean &lt;- tm_map(descriptions_corpus,content_transformer(tolower)) ##text transformation - lowercase
descriptions_corpus_clean &lt;- tm_map(descriptions_corpus_clean, removeNumbers) ##remove numbers
descriptions_corpus_clean &lt;- tm_map(descriptions_corpus_clean,removeWords, stopwords()) ##list of stopwords listed in the tm package
descriptions_corpus_clean &lt;- tm_map(descriptions_corpus_clean, removePunctuation)
descriptions_corpus_clean &lt;- tm_map(descriptions_corpus_clean, stripWhitespace)

descriptions_dtm &lt;- DocumentTermMatrix(descriptions_corpus_clean) ##this will create a sparse matrix with all the words found in the above having its own column with the number of its occurrence for each job description listed in the cell</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>We now create the training and test dataset, here I’ve used a 80:20 split (remember to set your seed to ensure reproducibility). Play around with the seed to ensure you have a proper representation of your industry in both datasets.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234501) 
train_sample &lt;- sample(4725,3780)

descriptions_dtm_train &lt;- descriptions_dtm[train_sample,]
descriptions_dtm_test &lt;- descriptions_dtm[-train_sample,]

descriptions_train_labels &lt;- data_flagged[train_sample,]$flag
descriptions_test_labels &lt;- data_flagged[-train_sample,]$flag</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>prop.table(table(descriptions_train_labels))
## descriptions_train_labels
##         No        Yes 
## 0.91984127 0.08015873
prop.table(table(descriptions_test_labels))
## descriptions_test_labels
##         No        Yes 
## 0.92418462 0.07581538</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Following is a wordcloud of those job descriptions marked as belonging to the Healthcare &amp; Medical Industry.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>yes &lt;- subset(data_flagged,flag==&quot;Yes&quot;)
wordcloud(yes$job_description,max.words = 100,scale = c(3, 0.5),random.order = FALSE)</code></pre>
