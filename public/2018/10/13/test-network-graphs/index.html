I was working on the <em>igraph</em> package in R at work a couple of weeks ago and although it did the job, it lacked a bit of a visual presence. Here is a <a href="https://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph">website</a> full of igraph network graphs for your reference.
</p>
<p>
Thought I’d have a look at D3 Network graphs. Looks promising thus far! Enjoying the interactivity of the nodes. It’s also very surprisingly easy to implement.
</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(networkD3)
data(MisLinks)
data(MisNodes)

forceNetwork(Links = MisLinks, Nodes = MisNodes, Source = &quot;source&quot;,
               Target = &quot;target&quot;, Value = &quot;value&quot;, NodeID = &quot;name&quot;,
               Group = &quot;group&quot;, opacity = 1)</code></pre>
