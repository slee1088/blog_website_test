      <description>Some Context
I noticed around a year ago while writing an email using Gmail that the application was suggesting how I should finish a sentence. A similar feature was added in LinkedIn not too while ago suggesting phrases to use on messages.
This piqued my interest and I started looking into how this was done and came across this amazing book by Francois Chollet and JJ Allaire which goes from basic theory to advanced practical applications on deep learning using the Keras framework (with Tensorflow as the backend engine).</description>

      <description>Some Context
One day after work, I was messaging with a friend (who’s extremely curious about data and it’s applications and a source of great ideas) and we were talking about scraping data from the internet and what tools were currently available and most easy to learn. R and Python sprang to mind and so we deep dived into some of the packages available in those languages. Then, funnily enough, the conversation turned to VBA and crude methods such as using sendkeys and how unreliable they were.</description>

After reading this really good machine learning textbook by Brett Lantz, I was left wondering where I could use some of the techniques taught in the book for my personal use.
Personally, when I search for jobs on websites like Seek, I tend to narrow my search to a specific role. The dangers with this is that, in recent times, data roles can go by many names. Different companies may use a different title for essentially the same role.</description>

      <title>Testing network graphs using D3</title>

      <description>I was working on the igraph package in R at work a couple of weeks ago and although it did the job, it lacked a bit of a visual presence. Here is a website full of igraph network graphs for your reference.Thought I’d have a look at D3 Network graphs. Looks promising thus far! Enjoying the interactivity of the nodes. It’s also very surprisingly easy to implement.</description>

      <description>Hi there, I&amp;rsquo;m Scott, currently working as a data analyst. I set this blog up to act as a repository for some of the interesting pieces of work that I do in my spare time and also to act as a quick resource for myself and others in my field for trivial tasks that can get easily forgotten in the details such as remembering the connection string used to connect to SQL server from a client software.</description>
