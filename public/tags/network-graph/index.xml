      <description>I was working on the igraph package in R at work a couple of weeks ago and although it did the job, it lacked a bit of a visual presence. Here is a website full of igraph network graphs for your reference.Thought I’d have a look at D3 Network graphs. Looks promising thus far! Enjoying the interactivity of the nodes. It’s also very surprisingly easy to implement.</description>
